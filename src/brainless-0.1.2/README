Brainless -- A chess playing program written in ANS Forth.

As this is work in progress, there are still several missing features, the
most important being:
	
  * no documentation
  * 50-move rule isn't checked yet
  * human players must use >remove< and >add< after a pawn promotion to
    select the piece of their choice

To run the program on ANS Forth systems, just load 'brainless.fs'.  On Unix
systems with Gforth installed, try './configure && make install' to install
Brainless as stand-alone application.

A long time ago I tested this program with GForth, PFE and BIGForth, but
nowadays I'm using Gforth exclusively.  If you find problems on an otherwise
ANS conforming system, please contact me!

If you want to play a game against Brainless, you'll have to use the Forth
terminal interface (have a look at tui.fs).  Load "brainless.fs", and type:

        help            \ to get Brainless' integrated help texts
	e2 e4 m		\ to do a move from e2 to e4
	cm		\ to let the computer move
	look		\ to have a look on the chessboard
	init-board	\ to initialize the chessboard to defaults
	e4 remove	\ to remove the piece on e4
	w pawn e4 add	\ to add a white pawn on e4
	clear		\ to clear the whole chessboard
	other-party	\ to switch the party that is at move
	6 TO max-think-limit	\ to let the computer think up to 6 plies
	3 TO abort-time		\ to make the computer abort thinking after
				\ 3 seconds
        TRUE TO use-arith-notation?	\ switch to arithmetic move notation

For Benchmarking load the file "benchmark.fs", and run the 'benchmark' word.
