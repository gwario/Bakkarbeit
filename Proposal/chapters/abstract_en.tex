\chapter*{Abstract}

\section{Problem definition}

In software engineering, the most important part is to verify the correctness of a program. The difficulty of this task grows with the size and the complexity of a program. Thus the task of finding faulty code takes a considerable amount of time and the efficiency of finding faulty code a major concern. There a several methods to improve the quality of code.

correctness
faulty code
methods to improve quality
debugging watch and break
in forth/gforth
println method and visualization of program execution
transparent and automated

\section{Expected results}

improvement of awareness of whats happening during execution and efficiency of finding faulty code

\section{Methodology and approach}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item research on program flow visualization
	\item research on forth
  \item research on architecture of gforth
  \item research on ``debugging'' in forth/gforth
  \item research of similar approaches
  \item extracting several technical approaches to accomplish the task(hooks, word-wrapping, level of implementation)
  \item evaluation of the approaches(automation?, performance, feasibility)
  \item prototyping the approaches in order of quality(?)
\end{enumerate}

\section{State of the art}
?

\section{Relation to Software engineering}

\begin{itemize}
	\item software testing(analysis, debugging)
	\item development process(rapid prototyping)
	\item stack-based language forth
