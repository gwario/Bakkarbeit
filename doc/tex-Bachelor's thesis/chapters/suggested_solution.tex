\chapter{Suggested solution/implementation}

\begin{itemize}
\item kind of an ide
\begin{itemize}
\item interactive program manipulation: state of the system before a word, after a word and by clicking on the word jumping to its definition and there also providing those features
\item stepping debugger mode: simply stepping through the whole code word by word
\item goal-oriented strategy: the definition of an execution scenario such that only the parts of interest of the software system are analyzed (Koenemann and Robertson, 1991; Zaidman,
2006).
\item other data structures and variables should be displayed
\item display of the 'vocabulary'
\end{itemize}
\item proof of concept by enhancement of stepping debugger on forth code level(cause it has turned out to be the fastest and simples approach) by showing additional data: the other stacks
