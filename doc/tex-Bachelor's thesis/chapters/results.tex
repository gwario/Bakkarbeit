\label{chap:Results}

In this chapter, I will introduce the chosen Forth software system. Afterwards, I will present the manually or semi automatically produced graphs of the selected visualization methods.

\section{The software under investigation: Brainless}

Brainless\footnote{Brainless verion 0.1.2 is used, the source code can be optained on \url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/forth-brainless/}} is a chess-playing program written in ANS Forth. The source code consists of several files with an overall size\footnote{The command to calculate the size was \emph{find . -name '*.fs' -maxdepth 1 | xargs wc -l}} of 139497 bytes and 4108 lines of code\footnote{The command used to count the lines of code, was \emph{find . -name '*.fs' -maxdepth 1 | xargs wc -l}}.
This measure is somehow controversial, but since the files contain only a short header and are formatted in the usual manner, it seems appropriate for comparison. The code is organized in a flat structure. There is one directory with 30 files, which contain 663 words. There is only one custom word list defined. Thus the visualization of a word list hierarchy makes obviously no sense and is left out in the following sections.

The other software system, I took into consideration, was brew\footnote{brew version 0.2.0 was used. The source code can be obtained on \url{http://www.robertepprecht.ch/brew/index.html}}. Brew is a 'playground for evolutionary programming', as the author calls it. Due to its size of 1062857 bytes and 36801 lines of code, this project seemed too large to be analyze manually in reasonable time.

For the following figures, I used a snapshot of an execution trace.
Since the calculations of the computer-moves produce a huge amount of word executions, the example trace, was created by making only the player-move: \emph{d2 d3 m} \keys{\return}. The snapshot contains all word executions after and including the execution of the word \emph{m}. It consists of 4709 word executions. Figures \ref{fig:brainless_before_m} and \ref{fig:brainless_after_m} show the state of the game before and after entering \emph{d2 d3 m} \keys{\return}.

\end{figure}

\end{figure}

\section{The application of the previously presented visualization methods}

\subsection*{Hierarchical edge bundles}

Figure \ref{fig:hierarchic_edge_bundle} shows the first 100\footnote{The calculation of the interaction lines consume a considerable amount of system resources, which prevents longer traces due to memory limitation.} word executions of the before mentioned trace snapshot in a \emph{hierarchic edge bundle}.

The outer ring labeled with \emph{brainless-0.1.2} represents the directory of the source code, the middle ring represents the files and the inner ring represents the words. Words which haven't been executed in this snapshot, have been omitted.
The word sectors are of equal angle, the number of different words divided by 360\degree. The file sectors' angle have been adjusted according to the number of files they contain.
The lines in the circle represent word executions. Same as in \cite{Holten:2006:HEB:1187627.1187772}, the word on the green end is the caller and the word on the red end is the callee. The distance between the turning point and the center of the circle depends on the distance(in degree) of the two word sectors, words with great distance are connected near to center. Multiple occurrences of caller/callee pair appear as one line in this graph. The exact algorithms used to calculate figure \ref{fig:hierarchic_edge_bundle} can be found in \hl{<appendix>}.

\subsubsection*{Interpretation}
The main problem in this manually generated picture is the limitation to  100 executions. Due to rendering time and memory requirement, it was not possible to visualize more executions with KTikZ\footnote{Version 0.10}.
Apart from that, the hierarchic edge bundle provides information on the complexity or importance of a word in this part of the execution trace(the number of words which are executed by one word, the number of distinct words which are executed by one word or the number of words which call one word).

Looking at the interaction lines, what stands out first, is the role of board.fs as caller and the role of threats.fs as callee. This leads to the assumption, that board.fs must contain controlling functions in this part of the trace. In contrast, threats.fs provides mainly utility words for board.fs.

\subsubsection*{Possible improvements}
A further improvement would be to draw multiple occurrences of the same caller/callee pairs(the interaction lines) with a slight gap to visualize all the executions. Or, if there are too many interaction lines, to show the exact number of interactions e.g. on hover.

Another improvement would be to show the names of the words in the hierarchic part, or if there are too much, to show them e.g. on hover.
Provided, that words are named expressively, the hierarchic edge bundle can also help to extract information on what happened during execution and how something happened. 

Due to the limitation to 100 executions, the not involved words could have been omitted in the hierarchic part.

    \label{fig:hierarchic_edge_bundle}
\end{figure}


\subsection*{Information murals and massive sequence view}

Figures \ref{fig:massive_sequence_view_1}, \ref{fig:massive_sequence_view_2} and \ref{fig:massive_sequence_view_3} show the trace snapshot in a \emph{massive sequence view}.

The \emph{massive sequence view} consists of the hierarchical part at the top of figure \ref{fig:massive_sequence_view_1} and the interaction part which follows immediately(figures \ref{fig:massive_sequence_view_2} and \ref{fig:massive_sequence_view_3}). The upper level of the hierarchical part, labeled with \emph{brainless-0.1.2}, again, represents the directory of the source code. The middle level, the files and the lower level, the words. Again, words which haven't been executed in this snapshot, have been omitted.
The interaction part shows the word executions as lines. As in \cite{Holten:2006:HEB:1187627.1187772}, the word above the green end is the caller and the word above the red end is the callee. The order of the interaction lines represents also the order of execution. The first executed word is represented by the upper most interaction line.

\subsubsection*{Interpretation}

With the massive sequence view, it is easy to identify certain steps of the program execution like the drawing part at the end of the trace(interaction with drawing.fs shown if figure \ref{fig:massive_sequence_view_2}) and the file writing part(interaction from epd.fs at the end of figure \ref{fig:massive_sequence_view_2}), if one knows the words defined in those files.

\subsubsection*{Possible improvements}

Figures \ref{fig:massive_sequence_view_1}, \ref{fig:massive_sequence_view_2} and \ref{fig:massive_sequence_view_3} clearly show the lack of interactivity. Without filtering, zooming, on-demand information on words(references to source code) and of course expressive naming, it is still hard to map sections of the trace to behavior. Besides these concerns, the massive sequence view seems to be well applicable to Forth program traces.

    \label{fig:massive_sequence_view_3}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{High-level polymetric views}

Figure \ref{fig:polymetric_view} shows a polymetric view of the snapshot. 
I used a circle to represent a single word. The radius reflects the number of executions, frequently executed words appear as larger circles. The position(distance from the origin) reflects the number of words executed within the word, fewer sub-word-executions result in a greater distance. If the number of sub executions vary, the maximum was used. The color of a circle reflects the io-behavior of a word. Red means, the word prints to stdout and yellow means it is reading from or writing to a file.

\subsubsection*{Interpretation}

Figure \ref{fig:polymetric_view_detail} shows a snapshot of the whole graph, containing the most often executed word(\emph{get-piece-masked}). This information can be valuable to identify words, suitable for performance improvements. Since optimizing words which are executed very frequently can significantly improve performance.

Through its short distance to the origin, the words \emph{m}, \emph{knight-moves} and \emph{.board} can be identified as high level words. At this point, it seems misleading, that the word \emph{knight-moves} is closer to the origin than \emph{pawn-moves}, since the move d2 d3 was the move of a pawn.

Through the colors, it is easy to identify the words \emph{epd-write-to-file} and \emph{epd-append-to-file} as words with file interaction. The words \emph{.hborder}, \emph{field-spaces} and \emph{display-move} can be identified as words responsible for drawing the chess board.

\subsubsection*{Possible improvements}

This graph was generated of an execution trace but it could also be used to show information gathered from static analysis. For example, it would be interesting to map the number of words within one word to the radius of the word's circle. And use the color of the word circles to highlight very complex words(with too many words in their definition or too many conditionals or nested loops).

    \caption{Sanpshot of the High-Level polymetric view of the trace of Brainless after \emph{d2 d3 m}}
    \label{fig:polymetric_view_detail}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Memory access view}

Figure \ref{fig:taxonomy} shows a small snapshot of the memory access of brainless.
It shows the words and the memory locations they access. The words are represented by circles and the memory locations(values) by rectangles. The arrows represent the direction of the access. An outgoing arrow(from a word to a memory location) represents write operation and an incoming arrow(from a memory location to a word), a read operation.
Since Brainless makes extensive use of \emph{value}s, does not use \emph{*variable}s at all and uses custom defining words only occasionally,  figure \ref{fig:taxonomy} shows only the \emph{value}s.

\subsubsection*{Interpretation}

Since the graph is very huge, it is not easy to keep track of the entire picture, but for debugging, it could be very helpful to see which other words manipulate certain memory locations to find the actual cause of a problem.

\subsubsection*{Possible improvements}

It should cover \emph{value}, \emph{variable}, \emph{2variable}, \emph{fvariable} and also memory fields, allocated by custom defining words. Figure \ref{fig:taxonomy} shows only a small snapshot of the whole graph, because the whole graph would have been too large(the graph grows with the number of words, which access memory locations).

\section{gfvis - A trace visualization enhancement for Gforth}

Gfvis was developed within this thesis, it is an enhancement for Gforths debugger \emph{dbg}(See Chapter \ref{chap:StateOfTheArt}).
Gfvis runs with a slightly modified version of Gforth(modified gforth-itc) and requires \emph{gv}\footnote{GV is a postscript viewer for X displays. For further information see: \url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gv/}}. It consist of \emph{gfvis.fs} and \emph{gfvis.ps}. Both have to be in the same directory. \emph{gfvis.ps} is a template file, written in postscript, it contains code to display the executed words and the state of the data stack, the floating stack and the return stack. \emph{gfvis.fs} contains code which collects the information to be displayed and to create and update \emph{trace.fs}.
\\
Gfvis is started by executing \verb|<path to modified gforth>/gforth-itc ./gfvis.fs|. When the dbg is started(i.e.\ \verb|dbg test|), trace.ps, a copy of gfvis.ps, is created and gv is started to display its content(See figures \ref{fig:traceps1} and \ref{fig:traceps2}). From then on, every executed word, updates trace.ps with the name of the word and the state of the stacks. When \verb|bye| is executed, gfvis terminates gv and gforth-itc.

\subsubsection*{Interpretation}

In figures \ref{fig:traceps1} and \ref{fig:traceps2}, I used the word \emph{test} to demonstrate the use of gfvis. \emph{test} contains conditionals, numbers, mathematical operations, sub word executions and it prints text to stdout. The source code of \emph{test} can be found in figure \ref{fig:gfvis-test-src}. With gfvis it is easy to follow the inner working of \emph{test}.

\subsubsection*{Possible improvements}

The first problem of gfvis is the very inefficient use of screen real estate. It would be better to show only the current and the previous stack state. The complete history should be shown only on demand and the displayed stack depth could be limited to a few elements(e.g. the 5 uppermost elements).

The second problem is the growing rendering time of \emph{gv}. With every new step, the whole files has to be re rendered, which takes a considerable amount of time for longer debugging sessions.

Another improvement would be to show not only the stack state, but also the content of \emph{value}s, *\emph{variable}s and custom defined memory.

Displaying all allocated memory areas and keeping track of changes within those areas in a \emph{diff} like manner,  would be helpful.

Better visualization of beginnings and ends of control structures and especially loops would also be an improvement.

Currently the stack states and executed words are stored within postscript code. A further improvement would be to store those traces in a standardized data format like json or xml.
