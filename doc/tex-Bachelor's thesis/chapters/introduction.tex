\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
\item software -> bug -> understand(up to 60\% \cite{Basili:1997:EPR:257260.257262} \cite{Pigoski:1996:PSM:524398} ) to fix
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Industrial software, due to its(steady growning) complexity \cite{Lehman:1985:PEP:7261}(need to read) \\ structured programming http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1243380
	\item software evolution \\

	\item maintainance \cite{Lientz:1980:SMM:601062} \cite{ISOSWMaintainance} \\

		code has to be understood \cite{Boehm:1976:SE:1311958.1312684} in order to make changes or add features \cite{Singer97anexamination}
	\end{itemize}
\item program comprehension
	\begin{itemize}
	\item strategies as stated by \cite{Storey:1999:CDE:308936.308940}
	\item dynamic analysis as defined by \cite{Ball:1999:CDA:318774.318944} \cite{Cornelissen:2009:SSP:1638616.1639301}
	\item static analysis as defined by \cite{Ball:1999:CDA:318774.318944}
	\item mental model(LaToza et al., 2006)\\ read:

	\item documentation artifacts(requirements to component diagram)
		\begin{itemize}
		\item source code level documentation \\ Ninus Khamis , Juergen Rilling , RenÃ© Witte, Assessing the quality factors found in in-line documentation written in natural language: The JavadocMiner, Data \& Knowledge Engineering, 87, p.19-40, September, 2013
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\item concatenative languages -> forth, postscript, factor
\item comparisson to oo langs
	\begin{itemize}
	\item paradigm promotes a single shared data structure of high importance and thus may simplify the task of putting all the necesarry runtime information visually together(cite someone who says that its important to have all information visible at every point in time). Although there are several stacks, features like arbitary memory allocation, the focus on stacks is clearly stated.
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item TODO implications from the concatenative nature...
	\end{itemize}

\section{problem statement (which problem should be solved?)}

\begin{itemize}
\item much work and tools on oo-languages
\item not so much on concatenative \sout{stack oriented} languages
\item applicability of oo-methods for concatenative \sout{stack oriented} languages at the example of forth
\item applicability of oo-visualization methods
\item suggestions of (new) methods
\end{itemize}

\section{aim of the work}

\begin{itemize}
\item identify all the information to be considered (and helpful) for program comprehension
\item actual visualization methods for these information
\item improve efficiency of program comprehension of concatenative languages
\item demonstration by enhancing the gforth stepping debugger(trace recording, trace visualization, goal-based approach possible)
\end{itemize}

\section{methodological approach}

\begin{itemize}
\item \hl{qualitative approach(?)}
\item \hl{proposal}
\item \hl{Preliminary evaluations as defined by} \cite{Cornelissen:2009:SSP:1638616.1639301}
\item \hl{outcome is a subjectiv view of the available methods, and proposed enhancements which have been implementet}
\item \hl{case study of the implemented enhancement}
\item \hl{suggestions of further enhancements}
\end{itemize}

\section{structure of the work}
