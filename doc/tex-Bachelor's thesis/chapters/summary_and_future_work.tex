\chapter{Summary and future work}

The pure exploratory approach did not provide any information on the actual impact of the implemented and suggested solutions. This gathering of quantitative date and the formulation of hypotheses remains to be done in further works.

summary of what has been done and the subjective conclusion

\section{further work to be done}

\begin{itemize}
\item how does software maintenance work in those languages?
\item ide
\item display of variable content
\item display of allocated memory areas
\item display of color diff with tooltip of previous values for stacks and memory areas
\item (better visualization of loops and control structures) is this even possible?
\item (display of the full program as a graph) is this even possible?
\item (customizable inspection depth) ?
\item type system for forth...see strongforth and the work of greg

\item static code analysis

v---- see previous chapter ----v
\item using a standard data type to store traces
\item stack depth per word
\end{itemize}

conclusion like what i contributed to the community!!\\

\section{further reading}

work on program comprehension of concatenative languages
good overview of the field \cite{Canfora:2011:ACS:1924421.1924451} and \cite{Cornelissen2009}
