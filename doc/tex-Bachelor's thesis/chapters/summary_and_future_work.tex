summary of what has been done and the subjective conclusion

\begin{itemize}
\item how does software maintenance work in those
\item ide
\item using a standard data type to store traces
\item display of variable content
\item display of allocated memory areas
\item display of color diff with tooltip of previous values for stacks and memory areas
\item (better visualization of loops and control structures) is this even possible?
\item (display of the full program as a graph) is this even possible?
\item (customizable inspection depth) ?
\item static code analysis
\begin{itemize}
\item stack depth per word
\item type system for forth
\item ...
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


conclusion like what i contributed to the community!!\\

work on program comprehension of concatenative languages
good overview of the field \cite{Canfora:2011:ACS:1924421.1924451} and \cite{Cornelissen2009}
