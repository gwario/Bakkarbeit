\section{comparison with related work}

\hl{? is there any? maybe the modifications to oo methods? or listing of the methods which did work and those which did not}

kgforth in some way

\section{discussion of open issues}

\begin{itemize}
\item not scaling well cause of limited screen real estate and thus the need to scroll
\item not scalign well cause of unpredictable stack height(maybe show only depth according to stack effect comment)
\item nature of gforth
	\begin{itemize}
	\item interpretation/compilation mix(how to integrate the adhook changes between modes '[]')
	\item implementation within the executing system
	\item lack of dynamic information(return stack add -> wordname heuristic)
	\end{itemize}
\item not suitable for performance meassuring cause debugger...
\item quantitative data on the effects the enhancement needed
\end{itemize}
