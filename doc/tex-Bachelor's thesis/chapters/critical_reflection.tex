\section{comparison with related work}

\hl{? is there any? maybe the modifications to oo methods? or listing of the methods which did work and those which did not}

\section{discussion of open issues}

\begin{itemize}
\item not scaling well cause of limited irgnedwas screen[...] and thus the need to scroll
\item not scalign well cause of unpredictable stack height(maybe show only depth according to stack effect comment)
\item nature of gforth
\begin{itemize}
\item interpretation/compilation mix(how to integrate the adhook changes between modes)
\item implementation within the executing system
\item lack of dynamic information(return stack add -> wordname heuristic)
\end{itemize}
\item not suitable for performance meassuring
\item quantitative data on the effects the enhancement
\end{itemize}
