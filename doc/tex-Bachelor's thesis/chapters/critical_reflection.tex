\section{comparison with related work}

light table ide(js) continuous reverse engineering idea of \cite{Muller:2000:RER:336512.336526} to provide immediate resonse of the systems output... although probably not applicable or very time consuming in setup(or not more than integration testing...) for most industrial scale software
eclipse ide(java)

\section{discussion of open issues}

\begin{itemize}
\item not scaling well cause of limited irgnedwas screen[...] and thus the need to scroll
\item not scalign well cause of unpredictable stack height
\item too much information not enough visible on demand aka interactivity
\item nature of gforth
\begin{itemize}
\item interpretation/compilation mix
\item implementation within the executing system
\item lack of static(and dynamic?) information
\end{itemize}
\item not suitable for performance meassuring
\item quantitative data on the effects the enhancement
\end{itemize}
