\chapter*{Abstract TODO}

In software engineering, an important part is to verify the functional correctness of a program. The difficulty of this task grows with the size and the complexity of a program. Thus the task of finding faulty code consumes a considerable amount of time and the efficiency of finding, understanding and fixing this faulty code is of major concern. A very efficient way to keep up code quality is to make developers understand how the code really works. In this thesis I'm going to implement a visualization of the program execution of Forth programs in Gforth and will analyse the improvement of user experience during debugging and time consumption of the process with example programs.
